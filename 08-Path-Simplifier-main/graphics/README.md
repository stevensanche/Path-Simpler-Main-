# graphics

Putting this in a subdirectory of a student project, graphics can be
imported with
```
import graphics.grapics as graphics
```

This is a fork of Zelle's graphics.py, originally forked December 2017.
Zelle's module is open-sourced as GPL, which requires the whole 
application to carry GPL license.  I prefer the more liberal 
CC-by-SA, but that will require me to independently reproduce a 
cleanroom reimplementation of 
portions of the graphics.py module.  I have not yet done that.
